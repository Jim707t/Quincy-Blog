I started coding at my 15 years but i started to get a serious interest in my 17. I was looking to learn by myself, I spent hours cogitate on problems attempted to solve them. And without realizing it, i was starting become an passionate. Since I continue to dive into this infinite universe by making all kinds of more suprising discorveries than others. If created this blog is to document my experiences, my passion hoping that someone benefits."
