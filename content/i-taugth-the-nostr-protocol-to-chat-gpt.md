In recent weeks we mainly hear about one thing "ChatGPT" even if you are not interested in these things you have probably heard about it. And yes I think he deserves all this attention when you see how powerful he is. Since the launch I have used it very frequently so frequently that I know his ways of answering and even if I was shown several texts, where some of them were generated by ChatGPT, I think I could detect them all. 
<br><br>
One thing I noticed about this model is these repeated errors, indeed I know that they did not guarantee us that he would be right for each answer but sometimes ChatGPT makes a lot of errors, for example on the dates and some other thing. I no longer have this data because before we did not have the history of our discussions with him. But now this feature is disponible when you have a conversation with him you have all the history even if you close the page when you come back later you can still continue in the same line about the same topic he will remember all stuff you said what kind of conversation he has with you, that why now I find it become yet more interesting and powerful. Why? So remember later I said ChatGPT wrong frequently in some topics. Remember he is not perfect and dont know everything perfectly eg: he dont know information after 2021 and he thinks he is in the 2021 year probability because he begon training since 2021. So what i have noticed yet is when i give him data and if i ask him a question later he will answer me based on these data so when he is wrong if i go check data and give him he will save these information to give me better answer.
<br><br>
Probably you are say so what the advantage of this? We lose time to check data and all that. Yes! i lose time to check data but I will be sure and have more confidence in what he tell me. All that to say is he will not be wrong like he can be sometime if you give him data based on any topic. For example, I used it to understand a protocol called <a href="https://nostr.com/" style="color: orange; text-decoration: underline;">Nostr</a>. We know that “ChatGPT” can’t browse so he can’t know recent events like the Nostr who is a recent protocol . So I wanted ask him question about this protocol so I could not ask it. Seeing that, I decided to teach him what Nostr is by giving him data about Nostr what i did is took info in the repo where they explained the protocol and copy-pasted all of the <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr" style="color: orange; text-decoration: underline;"> explanation </a> include the <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips" style="color: orange; text-decoration: underline;">Nostr Implementation Possibilities (Nips)</a> to him. 
<br><br>
So what i expected happened he understood the protocol and he was even able to find some problem of security on the protocol. When I asked him about Nostr and how to implement it he was able to explain it very well even answer some technical questions. I want to clarify that he doesn't know anything about Nostr. This is what he says when I asked him to tell me what Nostr is before I give him data:

<br><br>
Very well he wanted information. I was going to give him a ton of it myself. So like I said I gave to him all kinds of info of what the protocol is by copying and pasting them from their source, yes that took some minutes but I finally taught him all about Nostr i feel like I was a trainer ah ah.

<br><br>
Let’s take a look at what he said when I asked him the same question again.

<br><br>
Isn't it surprising?
A few minutes ago he was unaware of this thing and looking at it now with such great looks able to compare 2 technologie. The dude explains the protocol better than these creators I didn't tell you but with that I understood how long the protocol worked to even implement it because no it doesn't stop there. It even knows what role Nostr relays perform and how to send and receive outgoing public key data from the relay to the client.
<br><br>
Relay don’t talk to each other they just receive and send event to client (eg: An application, web application, or  mobile application) who want to interact with the Nostr network so why not make ChatGPT show use an example of how implement all this to make you get it, to allow us make a picture of that.
<br><br>
Remember I am alway in the same line of discussion with ChatGPT. I mean he doesn't know these information globally wich mean if you go ask him for these stuff without give him some data before he will can’t answer.

<pre style="max-width:800px;overflow-x:scroll">

import json
from websocket import create_connection

# Connect to relay using websockets
ws = create_connection("wss://relay.example.com/publish")

# Create event data
event_data = {
    "pubkey": "your_public_key_here",
    "created_at": int(time.time()),
    "kind": 1,
    "tags": [
        ["t", "example"],
    ],
    "content": "Hello, world!",
}

# Sign event
signature = "your_signature_here"

# Add signature to event data
event_data["sig"] = signature

# Send event data over websockets connection
ws.send(json.dumps(event_data))

# Close websockets connection
ws.close()

</pre>

In a general way this is how it works. For me I find that it is a good clear example
We can see that we can teach ChatGPT something and ask him questions About that. This way he will make less errors on topics that he doesn't know too much about.
What a powerful tool for learning and understanding simple and complex topics.
But we must while he can give accurate and detailed information on a specific topic when given enough data, it is not perfect and may still make mistakes or give incomplete or incorrect information if the data it is provided with is incomplete or incorrect. The data must be pure for better experience.
<br><br>

Actually I wanted to talk about the comparison Chat-GPT made between Nostr and Mastodon. 
Do you think he is right?
<br>
The problem with Mastodon is that some instance (server) owners may choose to sell user data to third parties, to make money while others may not. And that makes me feel insecure. I don't even read their policies but contrary to Nostr they user experience it very good like any other social media. Even some people may say the sign-in process has a lot of steps but let's be real it is not complex at all and I don't think people have reason to say it is complex not than manage a Nostr private key. With a password you can always remember it, but the private key no! unless you use a password manager no way to store it safe from hackers.
<br><br>
In any case i have to say one of the main stuff to think about to make the protocol be adopted massively is the private key you can’t remember it and if you growth an account and after lost your private key it done no recovery option sadly. That is why I think we have to think about this a lot. The protocol can improve and in the base way Nostr works. 
<br><br>
The 2 platforms have their own unique features and benefits, and it ultimately comes down to personal preference and the specific needs and goals for users. So yeah you see  how sometimes I can learn better with ChatGPT but you see how carefully we must use it. That's all, I just wanted to give a little feedback about it.
