Freedom is a complex and often contradictory concept. It's the idea that we're free to do whatever we want, without interference from others. It's when we choose do something like play video game during the whole night, or quit our boring job to travel. But as appealing as this notion of freedom might be, it's not without its problems.
<br><br>
It's now clear that we can ever truly be free in this sense, as our choices and actions are always constrained by various factors such as our desires, emotions, and beliefs. If i'm free why i have to do a work that i find boring In addition, this kind of freedom often leads to conflict with the public good, as people may exercise their freedom in ways that harm others or disrupt society. If someone exercises their freedom by driving drunk, they're not only putting themselves at risk, but also endangering the lives of others.
<br><br>
This is where i think the Stoic philosophy of freedom appears to be coherently understanding of the concept. The Stoics believed that true freedom is being in control of our emotions, desires, and actions, rather than being a slave to them. This means that true freedom is not about doing whatever we want without hindrance, but rather about acting in accordance with our values and principles, even if that means facing external constraints or obstacles.
<br><br>
In this view, i don't think freedom is not necessarily something that can be achieved once and for all, but rather a constant process of self-improvement and self-realization. I think it's about taking responsibility for our lives and choices, and actively working to shape our destiny, rather than passively accepting whatever comes our way. And this approach to freedom also allows to consider questions of whether freedom should respect the public right, as it recognizes that our freedom is not absolute, but must be balanced against the rights and interests of others.
<br><br>
The idea of staying up all night playing video games might sound cool, the Stoics would argue that true freedom is about being in control of ourself, and making choices that are in line with our values and principles. By adopting this approach to freedom, we can better navigate the complex and often fraught relationship between individual freedom and the public good, and live lives that are both fulfilling and meaningful.
