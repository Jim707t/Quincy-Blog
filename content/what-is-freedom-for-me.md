# What is freedom for me? 
<br>
Freedom is a complex and often contradictory concept. On the one hand, it's the idea that we're free to do whatever we want, without interference from others or external forces. This is the kind of freedom that lets us eat ice cream for breakfast, stay up all night playing video games, or quit our boring job to travel the world. But as appealing as this notion of freedom might be, it's not without its problems.
<br><br>
For one, it's not clear that we can ever truly be free in this sense, as our choices and actions are always constrained by various factors such as our own desires, emotions, and beliefs. In addition, this kind of freedom often leads to conflict with the public good, as people may exercise their freedom in ways that harm others or disrupt society. For example, if someone exercises their freedom by driving drunk, they're not only putting themselves at risk, but also endangering the lives of others on the road.
<br><br>
This is where the Stoic philosophy of freedom offers a more nuanced and coherent understanding of the concept. The Stoics believed that true freedom comes from being in control of our own emotions, desires, and actions, rather than being a slave to them. This means that true freedom is not about doing whatever we want without hindrance, but rather about acting in accordance with our own values and principles, even if that means facing external constraints or obstacles.
<br><br>
In this view, freedom is not something that can be achieved once and for all, but rather a constant process of self-improvement and self-realization. It's about taking responsibility for our own lives and choices, and actively working to shape our own destiny, rather than passively accepting whatever comes our way. And this approach to freedom also allows us to consider the question of whether freedom should respect the public right, as it recognizes that our own freedom is not absolute, but must be balanced against the rights and interests of others.
<br><br>
So, while the idea of eating ice cream for breakfast and staying up all night playing video games might sound fun, the Stoics would argue that true freedom is about being in control of our own lives, and making choices that are in line with our values and principles. By adopting this approach to freedom, we can better navigate the complex and often fraught relationship between individual freedom and the public good, and live lives that are both fulfilling and meaningful.
