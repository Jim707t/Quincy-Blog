Let's imagine you and i are custom BD and we living on a piece of paper, which is a two-dimensional(2D) world. We can move forward and backward, left, and right on the surface of the paper, but we can't move up or down. This is like living in a 2D world, where we can only experience two dimensions of space.
<br><br>
Now imagine that we somehow manage to climb up the edge of the paper and enter the third dimension which is impossible based on my conclusion that i will show you. Suddenly, we can move up and down as well as forward, backward, left, and right. we might even be able to jump off the paper and explore this new whole world.
<br><br>
This is the difference between living in a 2D world and a three-dimensional(3D) world. In a 2D world, we are limited to moving on a flat surface, while in a 3D world, we have the freedom to move in any direction.
<br><br>
The superior dimensions, they are even more abstract and difficult to imagine. For example in a four-dimensional space, we would be able to move in four directions instead of just three (yeah that difficult to image). This might allow us to do things that are impossible in our 2D world, like moving through solid objects or traveling through time.
<br><br>
An conclution we can make is that if we are in a inferior dimension we can't see a superior dimension to us that mean if you and i was a custom BD living in a 2D world we will not able to see a 3D world. We don't know but perhaps they have a 4D world and they can see us but we can't know it at all. In reality, Dimensions are mathematical concepts that are used to describe the properties of objects and phenomena in the physical world. But it helpful to imagine what it would be like to live in a world with different numbers of dimensions in order to better understand the concept.
