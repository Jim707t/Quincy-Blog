Imagine you are a tiny bug living on a piece of paper, which is a two-dimensional world. You can move forward and backward, left and right on the surface of the paper, but you can't move up or down. This is like living in a two-dimensional world, where you can only experience two dimensions of space.
<br><br>
Now imagine that you somehow manage to climb up the edge of the paper and enter the third dimension. Suddenly, you can move up and down as well as forward, backward, left, and right. You might even be able to fly or jump off the paper and explore a whole new world.
